#working

Each vote creates a block with a unique id .note id is different from the hash of a block
there are no duplicate id possible in the chain this preventes voters from spamng votes

the block .py file holds the block class and the block chin class
this covers pretty much anything unique from other block chain programs .
for proof of work we use the tradiotional method i.e no of '0' starting the hash increases as difficulty increment by one for each block 
though we may or may not need to change the difficuly curve. considering the population tunout fot the voting so it does not mak it yoo easy o calculate nor too difficult
